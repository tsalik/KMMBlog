# KMMBlog

Android and iOS apps for my [personal blog](https://tsalikis.blog/) developed with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile.

The project is under active development so there's [a number of pending todos](https://github.com/tsalik/KMMBlog/blob/trunk/todo.md) - one of them to set up CI.

The development style is based on the TDD flavor of [`Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests`](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com) book. You can also check all the decisions taken as code evolves in the [Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/tsalik/KMMBlog/tree/trunk/docs).

The following is needed before launching:

## Documentation
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] Test and Build insturctions
- [ ] Contributing Guidelines
- [ ] Code of conduct
- [ ] License

## Code 
- [ ] CI that must trigger in every PR
- [ ] Coding style
